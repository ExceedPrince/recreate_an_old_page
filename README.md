# recreate_an_old_page

This was a team project from the CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

We had to find a website which was really oldschool or neglected. It wasn't easy but we were managed to find to find one.
Our chosen one was the website of Alapítvány a Reaálértelmiségért. I don't want to say anything but this is their original website: http://www.c3.hu/~realalap/

So our job was to recreate it and make more better, functional and prettier. I think we aced it.

At this time we used only HTML and CSS, so this is still not a single page solution.
